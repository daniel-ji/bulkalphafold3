# Running Protein Complex Screens

As an additional feature of BulkAlphaFold3 aside from running AlphaFold3 predictions on a large set of prey proteins against a bait protein, we also provide scripts to run individual protein complex screens. This is primarily intended to see what AlphaFold3 predicts in terms of a protein complex forming between multiple proteins. It is worth noting that AlphaFold3 is not necessarily robust in predicting protein complexes (especially for large complexes or complexes with many proteins), but it can still potentially provide useful insights into possible interactions.
